# Covid-19-Vaccine-Analysis
Project Description: COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution and GDP Analysis

In this data-driven project, I embarked on exploring the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide and its correlation with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of each nation. Leveraging my expertise in data analysis and visualization, I undertook the following key steps:

1) Data Cleaning with Python
I began by downloading the COVID-19 dataset, which contained valuable information from various sources. Using Python, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. I addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and handled any anomalies that could affect the integrity of the results.

**2) Building an Interactive Dashboard with Tableau:**
To present the insights in a visually appealing and interactive manner, I harnessed the power of Tableau to create a comprehensive dashboard. The dashboard showcased the global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, including the total number of vaccinations (partly and fully) administered in different countries and regions.

3) Analyzing Vaccine Distribution Trends:
Through interactive visualizations, I analyzed the trends in vaccine distribution over time, identifying countries that led in vaccination efforts and regions with potential disparities. This analysis provided valuable insights into the progress of global vaccination campaigns.

4) Correlation with GDP:
As part of the project, I integrated GDP data for each nation into the dashboard. By comparing the vaccine distribution data with the GDP of each country, I sought to uncover potential relationships between a country's economic strength and its vaccination efforts.

6) Impact and Future Prospects
By visualizing the data and drawing meaningful insights, this project aimed to contribute to the global understanding of the COVID-19 vaccination landscape. The interactive Tableau dashboard can serve as a powerful tool for decision-makers, researchers, and the public to monitor and assess vaccination progress over time.

Conclusion
Through a combination of Python data cleaning and Tableau data visualization, this project successfully shed light on the relationship between COVID-19 vaccine distribution and a nation's GDP.
